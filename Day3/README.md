# Day 3 

Hey Guys hope you were able to complete the tasks in Day 2, if you are facing some issues feel free to put it up on the issues tab.

So today we will be looking at two very important libraries in Python - Numpy and Matplotlib.

Numpy is a python library used to handle matrices and Matplotlib is a visualisation library.

Both these libraries will be used a lot whenever you code in Python be it for Data science or Deep Learning or whatsoever.

## Links to the Notebooks

- Numpy [link](NumPy.ipynb)
- Matplotlib [link](matplotlib.ipynb)
- Some cool visualisation examples [link](cool_vis.ipynb)

I suggest you guys to spend enough time on these topics and try to complete the tasks we give today. We would love to help you out incase of any difficulties.
